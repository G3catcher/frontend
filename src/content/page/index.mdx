      ## Leaderboards


      The leadebroards here aggregate all runs that a runner has done across all games and attempts to assign them points.


      Some categories are weighted higher than others and this allows for a global Jak speedrunning leaderboard of sorts and encourages people to do runs outside of their preferred game.

## Purpose

Operated by the Jak speedrunning community, this serves as a place to do things that we cannot do on other platforms:
<div class="text-left">
- Publish write-ups around new glitches and strategies
- Compare and rank runners based on the runs they've submitted
- Track highscores
- and more!
</div>
